METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES FOR ENERGY CONSUMPTION ESTIMATES

========================================
1. GENERAL METHODOLOGY
========================================

All energy consumption values in this tool are measured in watt-hours (Wh), which represents the amount of energy consumed over time. The basic formula for calculating energy consumption is:

Energy (Wh) = Power (Watts) × Time (Hours)

For example, a 100-watt light bulb used for 2 hours consumes 200 watt-hours of energy.

Data sources include U.S. Department of Energy estimates, manufacturer specifications, peer-reviewed research, and industry reports from 2024-2026.

========================================
2. LIGHTING
========================================

INCANDESCENT LIGHTBULB (60W)
Traditional incandescent bulbs typically range from 25-100 watts, with 60 watts being the standard household bulb. One hour of use = 60 Wh.

LED LIGHTBULB (10W)
LED bulbs use approximately 75-85% less energy than incandescent bulbs for equivalent light output. A standard LED replacement for a 60W incandescent uses about 10 watts. One hour of use = 10 Wh.
